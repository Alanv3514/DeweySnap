Man and the Cosmos | 500 | Given that my edition (see the front cover image) is 40 years of age as I write this wee critique in the year of AD 2010, I doubt that many readers would not question some of the author's statements and opinions; but that's half of the fun. It is a publication full of confronting hypotheses, odd comments and a lot of proven facts. Whilst you might not agree with the writer, it's a damned good read.

Buddhist ethics | 294.3/5 | "Jamgon Kongtrul's monumental Encyclopedia of Buddhism (Treasury of Knowledge) contains a complete account of the major lines of thought and practice that comprise Tibetan Buddhism. Buddhist Ethics is the fifth part of that work and considered by many scholars to be its heart."--BOOK JACKET.

"This text presents the three major systems of ethics found in the Tibetan tradition. Widely known simply as the "three vows," these are the vows of personal liberation (pratimoksa), universal liberation (bodhisattva), and secret mantra (tantra). Jamgon Kongtrul explains the need for and nature of an authentic teacher-student relationship as the support for one's training in each system.

He then provides the complete code of personal liberation as it applies to both monastic and lay persons, the precepts for those aspiring to the life of a bodhisattva, and the exceptional pledges for practitioners on the tantric path of pure perception."--BOOK JACKET.

Czechs and Slovaks formed units in the Czarist Russian Army as well as the French and Italian.  After Russia had taken many Czechs and Slovaks as POWs from the Austro-Hungarian Army they requested to join these units.  Eventually they became an army independent of the Russians and under the authority of the Czechoslovak National Council.  After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk the Soviet Union planned to return the former POWs to Austria-Hungary.  The Czechoslovak Legion rebelled and fought the Red Army and the White Army on their way to Vladivostok.

Essays on ancient and modern Judaism | 296/.09 | Throughout his career, but especially in the final twenty years of his life, the great classicist and historian Arnaldo Momigliano (1908-87) wrote essays on a variety of Jewish themes and individuals. This volume collects twenty-six of these essays, most of which appear in English for the first time.

Momigliano acknowledged that his Judaism was the most fundamental inspiration for his scholarship, and the writings in this collection demonstrate how the ethical experience of the Hebraic tradition informed his other works.

Part 1 is devoted entirely to writings on ancient and medieval Judaism. In these essays, Momigliano ranges over such subjects as the stages of rapport between Hellenism and Judaism, the figure of Flavius Josephus, and the salient moments of Maccabean history. The overarching project unites pagan culture, Hebraic culture, and historiography.

Part 2 comprises Momigliano's writings on modern subjects. Here are profiles of Jewish scholars of the classical world (Bernays, Bickerman, and Finley) together with those of eminent representatives of contemporary Jewish thought (Strauss, Scholem, and Benjamin). These essays gain special significance alongside Momigliano's reflections on Italian Jewry and the Weberian interpretation of Judaism.

Silvia Berti's Introduction discusses Momigliano's religious and intellectual formation, the key events of his life, and the influence of Judaism on his mature scholarship. In his Preface, Momigliano offers a personal meditation on his own Judaism and that of his family.

Recipient of a staggering number of honorary degrees, Momigliano had acquired, by the time of his death, an international following. This volume will at last give his admirers in the English-speaking world easy access to an important body of his work.

The hammered dulcimer | 811/.54 | Lisa Williams's award-winning collection of poems is infused with what John Hollander calls "a guarded wonder." A poet of unique vision, she seems always to be "looking at," with special attention to the experience of the senses. In addition, Williams is concerned with epistemology - the how of seeing. And it is perhaps this quality of attention that informs her interest in the formulations of poetry itself, in its constructed dimension.

Her control of the line, of rhythmic possibilities, of structures both formal and free, is evident in every poem. Together, Lisa Williams's original voice and her poetic finesse allow her to create those harmonies of wonder evoked by the very instrument, the hammered dulcimer, that gives her collection its name.

Life in the air ocean | 813/.54 | In "Cave Fish," Daniel Mowry, Korean War veteran, expert in the design of domestic appliances (he tells himself he is making the world safe for women and children), is digging himself a real cellar, a crawl space below the kitchen floor. It's his way out, a place where he can tunnel down when his baby begins to scream.

In "Boy Wonder," it is 1937. Daniel is eleven and has a habit he can't beat. Sometimes he wakes up in the morning with the sheet plastered under him and turning cold. Daniel's mother says about it, "It's near every night with him. It's too hard." But Daniel sees a way out. He watches the crows fly swiftly from the yard and envies them. He's going to fly. He's going to be a Boy Wonder.

In the title story, Iris is exhausted from the travails of early motherhood, and is driven further over the edge when her husband suggests that they move to South America.

Taking us from 1937 to 1982, these stories explore the wilds of childhood and a barren landscape of adulthood, from the tar flats of Tennessee to the lush countryside of Bogota, Colombia, where the Mowrys go to live in the early sixties in an attempt to bring their world into line. But no matter what they do to escape one another, they find themselves back together - a closed-in society of four.

Theirs is a precipitous love that both cements the family and rends them apart, a love that the Mowry daughters endure and rebel against, each to reinvent her own.

Painting in Spain | 759.6/09/03 | Focusing on the interaction between art and the socio-economic and political conditions that prevailed in Spain's golden age, this book offers information about religious beliefs, social attitudes the activities of patrons and collectors, and how these were absorbed and interpreted by painters. The author sets the history of Spanish painting within a European context and explores Spain's contact with artistic centres in Italy and the Netherlands.

He discusses not only Spanish artists but also such non-Spanish painters as Titian, Rubens, and Luca Giordano, who either worked in Spain or influenced other artists there. Brown also examines the collections of foreign paintings that Spanish noblemen and prelates assembled and how these collections affected the production of art and the social status of the Spanish artist.

In this up-to-date and innovative analysis of two hundred years of Spanish painting, Brown describes a country that brilliantly transformed the artistic impulses it received from abroad to fit the needs of its own society.

State, power & politics in the making of the modern Middle East | 320.956 | This major new study provides the best general account to date of the recent political history of the Middle East. Roger Owen, a leading authority on Middle Eastern politics and history, presents a unique comparative treatment of central topics such as the growth of the Middle East state system, the place of the military, the role of religious organizations, the return to greater democracy, and the political response of Middle Eastern regimes to the economic crises of the 1970s and 1980s. The book provides a political history of all the Arab countries, as well as Israel, Iran, and Turkey, from the post-World War I period up to the present day. It will be important reading for those studying modern history and the Middle East, and for journalists, politicians and anyone who wants to know more about the current politics of the region.

The ghost of Major Pryor | 813/.54 | Barley Newton is cold sober the day he walks down the dusty street in the gold-mining town of Baddock in the Montana Territory. The year is 1870, and Barley knows he couldn't have seen what he just saw: The man who passes him on the street is Major Andrew Pryor. But this is impossible! Pryor was Barley's commander in one of the bloodiest of all Civil War battles. And Pryor was killed in battle in 1864, more than five years ago. His body was found and buried.

So why is Barley so sure it's Pryor he sees in the remote town of Baddock? And, stranger still, why is Barley Newton found dead soon after the mysterious encounter?

Back in Washington, officials at the War Department want some answers. It is almost unheard of for an officer to desert his troops. If Pryor, a West Point man, is indeed still alive, he must be apprehended and punished for the traitor he is. But Pryor has clearly taken a new name and identity and may be difficult to locate now that Barley Newton is dead. Captain Thomas Maynard, traveling incognito, is sent west to investigate.

News from the end of the earth | 918.30466 | John Hickman describes Chile's recent experience in its regional and historical setting.

He examines the reforms undertaken by the Christian Democrats in the 1960s; the political earthquake which followed the election of Salvador Allende and the Popular Unity coalition; the coup of 1973 and the subsequent ruthless repression of opposition by the military regime of General Pinochet; and the eventual economic renaissance within a free market system introduced by Pinochet, which made Chile's economy the most successful in Latin America.

This book presents a new view of the bitter conflicts of the 1970s and '80s and the struggle to restore democratic government which ended with the defeat of Pinochet in 1988-9. Finally it offers a preliminary assessment of the civilian governments of Patricio Aylwin and Eduardo Frei since 1990.

Triumph of the right | 324.9794/93043 | In this, the first book to deal exclusively with conservative politics in California, author Kurt Schuparra pinpoints the myriad factors that led to the formation and rise of the conservative movement in California after World War II, culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan as governor in 1966.

While Schuparra is concerned with prominent figures such as Ronald Reagan, California senator William Knowland, Richard Nixon, and Arizona senator Barry Goldwater, his larger interest is in the principal players in the movement behind these individuals, the causes they espoused, and the movement's role in pivotal electoral contests.

Schuparra also provides an assessment of how the struggle between liberals and conservatives - and those caught in the middle - in the Golden State both reflected and influenced the national debate over major governmental policies and social issues, particularly on racial matters.

The home guard | 941.084 | Today we laugh at 'Dad's Army', but in 1940 the threat of a German invasion of Britain appeared very real. S. P. MacKenzie's detailed and readable history of the Home Guard offers a new perspective on the men who took up the challenge. Despite its popular image of old men and teenagers playing soldiers, the Home Guard, often as large as the wartime army, became an astonishingly strong political force in its own right.

Quite literally the people in arms, it proved able to exert a good deal of influence on policy. The Home Guard was never called upon to fulfil its military role, though there was a brief attempt to resurrect it in the 1950s. Since then it has been largely neglected by military historians and there have been few serious examinations of the part it played in the Home Front.

What I Meant Was | 812/.54 | “God’s Heart is a play which dares to say very ugly things from a very moral place, which risks censure in an effort to reach an ugly truth; a play that’s wise to its own inescapable shortcomings and addresses them as part of its subject; a play which ought to have been greeted with exhilaration and joy, for it courageously refuses restraint and risks everything to live up to its impossible-to-live-up-to title.” –Tony Kushner, Civilization Magazine

“Best American play of the year! The Dying Gaul is Craig Lucas’s best work by far. This powerful parable jolts us with questions and doesn't insult us with answers.” –Donald Lyons, Wall Street Journal

This volume contains two of Craig Lucas’s most powerful and provocative full-length plays—God’s Heart and The Dying Gaul—with a suite of nine one-act plays. Together they illustrate the remarkable range and scope of a truly original American playwright.

Pocahontas (ca. 1595-1617) was born in what is now Virginia to Wahunsonacock, also known as Powhaton. She was of the Algonquin tribes. In 1614 she married John Rolfe (1585-1622) of Jamestown, Virginia. They were the parents of one son, Thomas Rolfe (1615-?). Pocahontas died during a visit to England. Thomas was the father of one child, Jane Rolfe (1650-1676) who married Robert Bolling and was the mother of one son, John Bolling (1675-1729). John Bolling married Mary Kennon and they were the parents of six children. Their numerous descendants live throughout the United States.

Naissance de l'idéologie fasciste | 320.5/33/094 | When The Birth of Fascist Ideology was first published in 1989 in France and at the beginning of 1993 in Italy, it aroused a storm of response, positive and negative, to Zeev Sternhell's controversial interpretations. In Sternhell's view, fascism was much more than an episode in the history of Italy. He argues here that it possessed a coherent ideology with deep roots in European civilization. Long before fascism became a political force, he maintains, it was a major cultural phenomenon.

This important book further asserts that although fascist ideology was grounded in a revolt against the Enlightenment, it was not a reactionary movement. It represented, instead, an ideological alternative to Marxism and liberalism and competed effectively with them by positing a revolt against modernity

.

Sternhell argues that the conceptual framework of fascism played an important role in its development. Building on radical nationalism and an "antimaterialist" revision of Marxism, fascism sought to destroy the existing political order and to uproot its theoretical and moral foundations. At the same time, its proponents wished to preserve all the achievements of modern technology and the advantages of the market economy.

Nevertheless, fascism opposed every "bourgeois" value: universalism, humanism, progress, natural rights, and equality. Thus, as Sternhell shows, the fascists adopted the economic aspect of liberalism but completely denied its philosophical principles and the intellectual and moral heritage of modernity

American foreign policy | 327.73 | We may be at an historic turning point. We live in a dangerous world, it is true - but it is also a world filled with opportunity. Democracy is spreading in Latin America and perhaps in Asia and Africa. The political polarization of the world has receded. Once again, the human race may be on the verge of a quantum jump, and the U.S. has an historic opportunity to lead the world into a new, even more advanced, global civilization. That is why the crafting of our foreign policy is so important.

And this book outlines the problems - and their solutions - of that policy. It will be of vital interest to students and policy makers.

Beast and man | 128/.3 | Philosophers have traditionally concentrated on the qualities that make human beings different from other species. In Beast and Man Mary Midgley, one of our foremost intellectuals, stresses continuities. What makes people tick? Largely, she asserts, the same things as animals. She tells us humans are rather more like other animals than we previously allowed ourselves to believe, and reminds us just how primitive we are in comparison to the sophistication of many animals. A veritable classic for our age, Beast and Man has helped change the way we think about ourselves and the world in which we live.
