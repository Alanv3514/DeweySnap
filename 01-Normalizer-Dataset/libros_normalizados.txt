Man and the Cosmos | 500 | Given that my edition (see the front cover image) is 40 years of age as I write this wee critique in the year of AD 2010, I doubt that many readers would not question some of the author's statements and opinions; but that's half of the fun. It is a publication full of confronting hypotheses, odd comments and a lot of proven facts. Whilst you might not agree with the writer, it's a damned good read.

Czechs and Slovaks formed units in the Czarist Russian Army as well as the French and Italian.  After Russia had taken many Czechs and Slovaks as POWs from the Austro-Hungarian Army they requested to join these units.  Eventually they became an army independent of the Russians and under the authority of the Czechoslovak National Council.

The Czechoslovak Legion rebelled and fought the Red Army and the White Army on their way to Vladivostok.

And it is perhaps this quality of attention that informs her interest in the formulations of poetry itself, in its constructed dimension.

State, power & politics in the making of the modern Middle East | 320 | This major new study provides the best general account to date of the recent political history of the Middle East.

The book provides a political history of all the Arab countries, as well as Israel, Iran, and Turkey, from the post-World War I period up to the present day.

Despite its popular image of old men and teenagers playing soldiers, the Home Guard, often as large as the wartime army, became an astonishingly strong political force in its own right.

Naissance de l'idéologie fasciste | 320 | When The Birth of Fascist Ideology was first published in 1989 in France and at the beginning of 1993 in Italy, it aroused a storm of response, positive and negative, to Zeev Sternhell's controversial interpretations. In Sternhell's view, fascism was much more than an episode in the history of Italy. He argues here that it possessed a coherent ideology with deep roots in European civilization. Long before fascism became a political force, he maintains, it was a major cultural phenomenon.

American foreign policy | 327 | We may be at an historic turning point. We live in a dangerous world, it is true - but it is also a world filled with opportunity. Democracy is spreading in Latin America and perhaps in Asia and Africa. The political polarization of the world has receded. Once again, the human race may be on the verge of a quantum jump, and the U.S. has an historic opportunity to lead the world into a new, even more advanced, global civilization. That is why the crafting of our foreign policy is so important.

Beast and man | 128 | Philosophers have traditionally concentrated on the qualities that make human beings different from other species. In Beast and Man Mary Midgley, one of our foremost intellectuals, stresses continuities. What makes people tick? Largely, she asserts, the same things as animals. She tells us humans are rather more like other animals than we previously allowed ourselves to believe, and reminds us just how primitive we are in comparison to the sophistication of many animals. A veritable classic for our age, Beast and Man has helped change the way we think about ourselves and the world in which we live.
